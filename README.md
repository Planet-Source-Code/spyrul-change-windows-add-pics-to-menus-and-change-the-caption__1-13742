## Change Windows \(add pics to menus and change the caption\)


</div>

### Description

This code lets the user change the caption of a window, and it lets them add a small picture to the menu item of their choice. All they have to do is enter the current window's caption (and main and sub menus for menu change) for it to work. This could be used for whatever you want... You could even add to it and let the user move the form, resize it, or just go wild with it... it might even help you with your own program because it looks kind of fancy when you have those little pics beside your menu items... My code isn't well commented so, if you have any problems, feel free to respond or email me at osirus2685@hotmail.com... please vote... and thanx
